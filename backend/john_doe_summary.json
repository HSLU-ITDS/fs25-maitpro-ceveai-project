        "5+ years of Python experience": {
            "score": 7,
            "explanation": "The CV states 'over 7 years of experience' in software engineering, and lists Python as a skill. However, it doesn't explicitly quantify Python experience.  While the overall experience suggests significant Python use,  lack of specific projects or quantifiable achievements related to Python lowers the score. More detail on Python projects would improve this."

        "Bachelor's degree in Computer Science": {
            "score": 10,
            "explanation": "The CV clearly states a 'Bachelor of Science in Computer Science' from University of Anytown. This perfectly fulfills the criterion."
        },
        "Experience with AWS": {
            "score": 0,
            "explanation": "There is no mention of Amazon Web Services (AWS) anywhere in the provided CV content."
